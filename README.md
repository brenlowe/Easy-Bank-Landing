# EasyBank Landing Page Project

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, SCSS

This was a beginner project from Front End Mentor to reinforce my understanding of HTML structuring and organizing styles and SCSS under a project page. 
The landing page is static; no real Javascript in this project, but it did cement a lot of tricks with CSS, and I now comprehend the cohesion between CSS and HTML using classes and IDs.

I had the chance to play around with hover states, and responsive design. This whole page is built mobile-first which is the easiest, most efficient approach.
