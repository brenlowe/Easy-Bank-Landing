# EasyBank Landing Page Project

# This project was initialized to help myself understand organizing styles and SCSS under a project page. 
The landing page is static built with HTML, CSS, and SCSS. No real Javascript in this project, but it did cement a lot of tricks with CSS,
and I now comprehend the cohesion between CSS and HTML using classes and IDs.
