# EasyBank Landing Page Project

This project was initialized to help myself understand organizing styles and SCSS under a project page. 
The landing page is static built with HTML, CSS, and SCSS. No real Javascript in this project, but it did cement a lot of tricks with CSS,
and I now comprehend the cohesion between CSS and HTML using classes and IDs.

I had the chance to play around with hover states, and responsive design. This whole page is built mobile-first which is the easiest, most efficient approach.
